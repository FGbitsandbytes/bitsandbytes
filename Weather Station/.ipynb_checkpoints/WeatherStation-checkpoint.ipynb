    "This weather station is the perfect little hobby project for anyone wishing to start monitoring the weather conditions in a specific room, outside or anywhere you would like.\n",

    "For anyone who doesn’t know, the [Sense HAT is a fantastic piece of equipment](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-sense-hat/) that comes with a large abundance of sensors all in a single package. It’s the easiest way of [adding a ton of sensors](https://pimylifeup.com/category/raspberry-pi-sensors/) to the Pi without needing to do any extra circuitry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This weather station tutorial will show you how to set up the sense HAT software itself and how to retrieve the data from its three primary sensors, those being the temperature, humidity and pressure sensors. We will also briefly touch on how to write text to the LED Matrix as we will use this as a way of displaying your sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also go into setting up your Raspberry Pi weather station so that the data is stored on Initial States Data analytics service, and this will allow us to stream the data directly to their web interface and view all the data in a pretty graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will make use of a large amount of Python code, but luckily it’s all pretty basic so you shouldn’t have too many problems following it.\n",
